# Reccomendations
**After the analysis, these would be the data driven recommendations we would give:**

Focus on the top grossing genres going well in the international market which include the Action/Adventure, Fantasy and Sci-Fi. Microsoft should also look into partnering with Buena Vista productions studio or do thorough benchmarking to get advise and guidance from the best in the game of movie production.

When making movies, consider runtimes of 100 â€“ 120 minutes. We have drawn this insight from the average runtimes computation, meaning it suits most of the audience.

Since there are averagely 3000 movies released annually, investing on proper marketing to popularize the movies will help rate their movies among the top hence gaining a positive reputation on the brand and a bigger audience.

Lastly, money begets money! The higher the investment on movie budget, the higher the return on investment. We should start looking at an around half a billion dollars in order to be among the top.
